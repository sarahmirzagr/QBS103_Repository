## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# READ IN CSV FILES

filenames <- list.files(path = "/Users/sarahmirza/Documents/GitHub/QBS103_Repository/", pattern = ".csv")
#print(filenames)

for (file in filenames){
  the_file <- read.csv(file)
  print(head(the_file))
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/sarahmirza/Documents/GitHub/QBS103_Repository/")

for (file in filenames){
  the_file <- read.csv(file) 
  age_var <- the_file$age
  histogram <- ggplot(the_file, aes(x=age_var)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "darkgreen")
  plot(histogram)
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
